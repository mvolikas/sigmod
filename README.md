My solution for the [2018 ACM SIGMOD programming contest](https://transactional.blog/sigmod-contest/2018).

Depends on [oneTBB](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onetbb.html) for task-based parallelism.

It was awarded the [6th place](https://db.in.tum.de/sigmod18contest/leaders.shtml#:~:text=Turing).
